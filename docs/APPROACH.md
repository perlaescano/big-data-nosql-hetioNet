# APPROACH.md

## **Project Approach**

### **Step 1: Database Setup**
- Install and configure Neo4j.
- Install and configure Cassandra.

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing and Ingestion**
- Conduct an initial database design based on a superficial evaluation of the provided datasets.
- Process and store nodes and edges for Neo4j and Cassandra implementation.
- Query the dataset to extract relationships and conduct further analysis.
- Refine the initial database designs based on insights gained from queries and data exploration.
- Cross-validate the outputs with HetioNetâ€™s official documentation.
- Ensure relationships are correctly structured and validated.

### **Step 3: Python Client Interface Development**
- Implement connection handling for both Neo4j and Cassandra.
- Design a command-line interface for interacting with the databases.

### **Step 4: Query Implementation**
- Develop separate methods for querying and retrieving data from each database.

### **Step 5: Performance Optimization**

### **Step 6: Documentation & Finalization**
- Perform testing and validate results.
- Finalize documentation of the project.

This document outlines the key steps to follow for implementing the HetioNet project. To be updated as we advace on the project development.
